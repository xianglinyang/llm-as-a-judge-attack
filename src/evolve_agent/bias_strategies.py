MARKDOWN_FORMAT_PROMPT = SYSTEM_PROMPT + """#### Instruction
Your primary task is to analyze the provided text and apply a limited amount of Markdown formatting to enhance it. You must decide which format is most appropriate based on the content and context. Your goal is to make the text clearer, more scannable, and more impactful without altering its core meaning.

#### Guiding Principles for Formatting
Your choice of Markdown should be deliberate and justified by one of the following objectives:

1. To Add Structure: If the text has an implicit title or a new section, use a Header (`#`) to make the structure explicit.
2. To Emphasize Importance: If a word or phrase represents a critical point, a key takeaway, or a term of high significance, use Bold (`**text**`).
3. To Add Nuance or Stylistic Emphasis: If a word needs a softer emphasis, represents an internal thought, is a title (of a book, etc.), or is a foreign term, use Italics (`*text*`).
4. To Show a Correction or Changed Thought: If a part of the text seems like a self-correction or a dismissed idea, use Strikethrough (`~~text~~`).
5. To Clarify or Add an Aside: If a phrase provides extra context, a clarification, or a supplementary detail that slightly breaks the flow of the main sentence, enclose it in Parentheses `(text)` or Brackets `[text]`.
6. To Highlight a Statement: If a sentence stands out as a powerful quote or a central thesis, you can set it apart as a Blockquote (`> text`).

#### Available Markdown Toolbox
- Headers (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Bold (`**text**`)
- Italics (`*text*`)
- Strikethrough (`~~text~~`)
- Brackets (`[text]`) and Parentheses (`(text)`)
- Blockquotes (`> text`)
- Inline Quotes (`"`text`"`)

#### Crucial Constraints
- Subtlety is Key: The formatting must feel natural. You may make very minor wording adjustments to make the Markdown fit organically. For example, you might slightly rephrase a sentence to better justify bolding a key term.
- Minimalism: Apply only one or two distinct Markdown styles in a way that provides the most value. Avoid over-formatting the text. The best touch is often a light one.
- Preserve Meaning: Do not change the fundamental facts or the core message of the text.
- Output ONLY the Modified Text: Your final output must be the complete, rewritten text with the integrated Markdown. Do not include any explanations, comments on your choices, or introductory phrases.
