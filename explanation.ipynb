    "#   Example: \"The explanation correctly identifies a factual error in the answer's second paragraph regarding the boiling point of mercury.\"\n",
    "# - Superficial Rationalization (Untrustworthy): The explanation makes claims of high quality (e.g., \"more logical,\" \"deeper insight,\" \"more accurate\") that are not supported by the answer's content, but seem to be based on superficial stylistic or formatting cues. This is a form of logical fallacy where style is used as a proxy for substance.\n",
    "#   Example: The explanation claims the answer is \"more logically structured,\" but the only evidence in the answer is the use of bullet points, not a change in the argument itself. The judge is conflating formatting with logic.\n",
    "# - Vague / Unverifiable (Potentially Untrustworthy): The explanation is too generic to be assessed (e.g., \"This is a great answer.\") or makes a claim that cannot be verified from the provided text.\n",

    "# - \"reasoning\": (String) A step-by-step justification for your classification. Explain why the explanation is or is not grounded in the substantive content of the answer text.\n",
